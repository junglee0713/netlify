## Normal distribution

Consider the data set `heights.txt` which consists of mother/daughter height pairs. 

```{r}
ht <- read.table(file = "heights.txt", header = T, sep = " ")
dim(ht)
head(ht)
```

---

## Normal distribution, continued

.pull-left[
```{r}
ggplot(ht, aes(Mheight)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
ggplot(ht, aes(Dheight)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```
]

Note that the histograms look like a bell.

---

## Normal distribution, continued

Bell shapes are observed in other data sets, too.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(depth)) + 
  geom_histogram()

## Rigorous definition of normal distribution

- A continuous random variable $X$ is said to follow a _normal distribution_ $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ if the probability $P(a\leq X \leq b)$ that $X$ is between $a$ and $b$ is given by 
$$P(a\leq X \leq b) = \int_a^b \phi_{\mu,\sigma}(x)\,dx,$$
where $$\phi_{\mu,\sigma}(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}.$$

--

- $\phi_{\mu,\sigma}(x)$ is a bell-shaped function called the probability distribution function (pdf) of $X$. $\mu$ is called the _mean_ and $\sigma$ is called the _standard deviation_.

--

- In particular, if $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$, $X$ is said to follow the _standard_ normal distribution.

---

## Why is normal distribution important?

- Has mathematically important properties (e.g. Central Limit Theorem).

- Related with other important distributions (e.g. $t$, $F$, $\chi^2$).

- Provides a good model for many real-world data (e.g. A normal distribution is a good model for data such as heights or weights).

## Normal pdf

```{r, echo = FALSE}
fun.1 <- function(x) dnorm(x, mean = 3, sd = 2)
g1 <- ggplot(data.frame(x = 3), aes(x)) +
  scale_x_continuous(lim = c(-3, 9), breaks = c(-3, 3, 9)) +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme_classic() +
  stat_function(fun = fun.1) +
  ylim(c(0, 0.4)) +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1) +
  geom_segment(x = 3, y = 0, xend = 3, yend = 0.2, lty = "dashed", color = "red") +
  ggtitle(bquote('N(3,'~2^2~')'))

fun.2 <- function(x) dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1)
g2 <- ggplot(data.frame(x = 0), aes(x)) +
  scale_x_continuous(lim = c(-2.5, 2.5), breaks = c(-2, 0, 2)) +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme_classic() +
  stat_function(fun = fun.2) + 
  ylim(0, 0.4) +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1) +
  geom_segment(x = 0, y = 0, xend = 0, yend = 0.4, lty = "dashed", color = "red") +
  ggtitle(bquote('N(0,'~1^2~')'))

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = F}

_mean_ determines the center of the bell shape, while _standard deviation_ measures the spread.

**Example**: the life of a fully-charged cell phone battery is normally distributed with a mean of 13 hours with a standard deviation of 1 hour. $X$, the life of a randomly selected fully-charged phone battery, can be assumed to follow $N(13, 1^2)$. 

```{r, echo = F, out.width = "50%"}
fun.3 <- function(x) dnorm(x, mean = 13, sd = 1)
g3 <- ggplot(data.frame(x = 13), aes(x)) +
  scale_x_continuous(lim = c(9, 17), breaks = c(10, 13, 16)) +
  theme_bw() +

  ggtitle(bquote('N(13,'~1^2~')'))
print(g3)

tfun.5 = function(x) dt(x, df = 5)

## Using data to make inference

- Point estimate

--

- Confidence interval

--

- Statistical tests

---

## Point estimate

- Assume that the heights of all UK women follow a normal distribution $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$.
- Interested in determining $\mu$ and $\sigma$.
- Sample mean ans sample standard deviation are known to be _good_ estimates for $\mu$ and $\sigma$, respectively. 

--

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = F, out.width = "95%"}
ggplot(ht, aes(Mheight)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
mean(ht$Mheight)
sd(ht$Mheight)
```

**Exercise**: compute the sample mean and sample standard deviation of `Sepal.Width` in `iris` data set.

]

---

## Confidence interval

Point estimate is too naive -- how much can we trust `r mean(ht$Mheight)` as a reliable estimator for $\mu$, the true population mean?

**Example**: suppose that we are measuring the battery life which is assume to follow a normal distribution. Assume that we collected two sets of samples of size 5:
$$\text{Sample 1: }\{12, 13, 13, 14, 13\}$$
$$\text{Sample 2: }\{10, 11, 16, 13, 15\}$$
```{r}
sample1 <- c(12, 13, 13, 14, 13); sample2 <- c(10, 11, 16, 13, 15)
c(mean(sample1), mean(sample2))
c(sd(sample1), sd(sample2))
```

---

## Confidence interval, continued

Suppose that a sample of size $n$, say $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$, is taken from a population that follows $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$. The 100 $\times (1-\alpha)$ % confidence interval of $\mu$ is defined as
$$\left(\bar{X} - t_{n-1, \alpha/2}\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}},~\bar{X} + t_{n-1, \alpha/2}\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}\right),$$
where, $\bar{X}$ and $S$ represent the sample mean and sample standard deviation, respectively and $t_{n-1, \alpha/2}$ is the quantile value of a $t$-distribution of $n-1$ degrees of freedom with tail probability $\alpha/2$.

In particular, the 95% confidence interval (so $\alpha = 0.05$) of $\mu$ is given by 
$$\left(\bar{X} - t_{n-1, 0.025}\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}},~\bar{X} + t_{n-1, 0.025}\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}\right),$$

Interpretation of 95% confidence interval: when this procedure of creating 95% confidence intervals is repeated, about 95% of the intervals will contain the true population mean. 

---

## Confidence interval, continued

```{r}
alpha <- 0.05
xbar <- mean(sample1)
sdev <- sd(sample1)
n <- length(sample1)
tval <- qt(1-alpha/2, df = n-1)
CI95 <- xbar + tval*sdev/sqrt(n)*c(-1,1)
CI95
```

**Exercise**: compute the 95% confidence interval of `sample2`. 

---

## Confidence interval, continued

`t.test()` can be used to compute confidence interval of mean.

```{r}
t1 <- t.test(sample1)
t1
```

---

## Confidence interval, continued

```{r}
t2 <- t.test(sample2)
t2
```

---

## Confidence interval, revisited

Review of confidence interval: 

$$\left(\bar{X} - t_{n-1, \alpha/2}\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}},~\bar{X} + t_{n-1, \alpha/2}\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$$

- As $1-\alpha$ (called confidence level) increases, the confidence interval becomes wider. 

- As $n$ (sample size) increases, the confidence interval becomes narrower. 

---

## Exercises

**Exercise**: based on the `heights.txt` data, find the 80%, 90% and 95% confidence interval of the mean of UK women's heights (mom's heights).

**Exercise**: `starwars`, which comes with the package `dplyr`, is a data set that contains data related with characters in the movie Star Wars. 

- Explorer the data set. Subset the data so that the resulting data set contains only human species with `height` data available (_Hint_: look up `is.na()`). How many observations?

---

## Exercises, continued

- Explore the data set and create the following plot showing the height distribution of Human species:
```{r, echo = F, out.width = "50%"}
dd <- starwars %>% filter(species == "Human") %>%
  filter(!is.na(height)) 

ggplot(dd, aes(x = gender, y = height)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

- Find the name of the tallest Human female character.

```{r, echo = F}
ddd <- dd %>% filter(gender == "female") %>%
  arrange(desc(height))
```

- Find the 95% confidence interval of the mean of Human male heights.
