## One-sample _t_-test, review

Under the assumption that the population follows $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, we test the null hypothesis $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$. 

--

- From samples $X_1,X_2,\ldots, X_n$, compute $t=\frac{\bar{X}-\mu_0}{S/\sqrt{n}}$, where $\bar{X}$ and $S$ denote the sample mean and sample standard deviation, respectively. 

--

- It is known that $t$ follows a $t$-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.

--

- If $t$ seems to be unlikely to have been generated from a $t$-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom (e.g. $p$-value is small), then maybe it is because our null hypothesis $H_0$ is not valid. 

--

- In general, if $p$-value is less than $0.05$, we reject the null hypothesis. If $p$-value is greater than $0.05$, then we do not reject the null hypothesis.

---

## One-sample _t_-test, example

Download a tab-delimited file [donkey.tsv](donkey.tsv). 

```{r}
donkey <- read.table("donkey.tsv", header = T, sep = "\t") 
dim(donkey)
head(donkey)
```

---

## One-sample _t_-test, example

- Donkey: donkey ID

- Sex: sex

- Age: age in years

- Bodywt: body weight in kg

- Heartgirth: girth at the level of the heart (cm)

- Umbgirth: girth at the umbilicus (cm)

- Length: length from the olecranon to the tuber ischii (cm)

- Height: height at the withers (cm)

---

## One-sample _t_-test, example

Assume that body weights of donkeys follow a normal distribution $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ and test the null hypothesis $H_0: \mu = 125$.

.pull-left[
```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(donkey, aes(Bodywt)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 25) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 125, #<<
             lty = "dashed", #<<
             color = "red") + #<<
  theme_classic() #<<
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = F}
ggplot(donkey, aes(Bodywt)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 25) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 125,
             lty = "dashed",
             color = "red") +
  theme_classic()
```
]

---

## One-sample _t_-test, example

```{r}
t.test(donkey$Bodywt, mu = 125)
```

--

Based on the $p$-value, we do NOT reject the null hypothesis. 

---

## One-sample _t_-test, example

What if $H_0: \mu = 130$?

```{r}
t.test(donkey$Bodywt, mu = 130)
```

--

Notice that $130$ is not captured by the 95% confidence interval. This is consistent with the interpretation of the 95% confidence interval.

## Inference on proportion

**Example**: 

A sample of 1150 cattle is randomly selected from the population in an area. Among those 1150 cattle, 361 were found to have been exposed to *Leptospira* infection. What can you say about the true proportion of cattle exposed to *Leptospira* infection among the whole population in the area? 

--

- Point estimate

--

- Confidence interval

--

- Hypothesis test

---

## Inference on proportion, continued

- Point estimate

```{r}
infected <- 361
n <- 1150
p <- infected/n # sample proportion
print(p)
```

--

- 95% confidence interval is _approximately_ given by

$$\left(p - 1.96\times \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}},~p + 1.96\times \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\right)$$

```{r}
p + 1.96*sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)*c(-1,1) # 1.96 from qnorm(1-0.025)
```

--

We are 95% certain that the true proportion is captured by this interval.

---

## Inference on proportion, continued

- Hypothesis test

--

  - Assume that $H_0: \pi = 0.34$, where $\pi$ denotes the true population proportion of the infected. 
  
--
  
  - Is our data for $H_0$? or against $H_0$?
  
--
  
  - Our decision is based on $p$-value. If $p$-value < 0.05, reject $H_0$. Otherwise, do not reject $H_0$.
  
--

  - $p$-value can be obtained from `prop.test()` function.
  
---

## Inference on proportion, continued

If the sample size $n$ is large enough, then 

- The sample proportion $p$ approximately follows $N\left(\pi,\frac{\pi(1-\pi)}{n}\right)$ (a consequence of *the Central Limit Theorem*). 

- The $(1-\alpha)\times 100$% confidence interval of $\pi$ is approximately given by 
$$\left(p-z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}, p+z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\right).$$
Here $z_{\alpha/2}$ denotes the quantile value such that the probability $Z\geq z_{\alpha/2}=\alpha/2$, where $Z$ follows the standard normal distribution $N(0,1^2)$.

---

## Inference on proportion, continued
  
```{r}
prop.test(infected, n, p = 0.34)
```
  
--

Based on the $p$-value, we do not reject $H_0$.

## Two-sample _t_-test

**Example**: consider the comparison of the mean body weights at the time of mating in one group of ewes which have been flushed (put on a high plane of nutrition for 2-3 weeks prior to mating) and another group which have
not.

```{r}
cont<- c(62.5, 63.9, 69.2, 66.8, 65.7, 62.6, 69.5, 67.2, 61.1, 
         64.1, 65.2, 61.8, 65.3, 63.5, 69.6, 65.6, 65.3, 71.1, 
         66.4, 65.1, 67.0, 66.1, 64.8, 67.5, 68.6, 67.4, 68.2, 
         62.5, 66.0, 63.6)
fl <- c(70.7, 67.8, 69.8, 71.8, 66.8, 68.1, 64.9, 67.0, 66.0, 
        68.2, 67.1, 69.4, 69.4, 67.6, 69.8, 64.4, 66.1, 67.9, 
        66.9, 62.7, 66.2, 69.4, 64.6, 64.2)
c(length(cont), length(fl)); c(mean(cont), mean(fl))
```

What is your point estimate for the difference of means? 95% confidence interval? Can we say that there is no difference in the mean body weights in the
two populations?

---

## Two-sample _t_-test, continued

```{r}
## make group, a variable for membership
group <- c(rep("ctrl", length(cont)), rep("flshd", length(fl)))
weight <- c(cont, fl)
df <- data.frame(group, weight)
dim(df)
```

--

.pull-left[
```{r}
head(df)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
tail(df)
```
]

---

## Two-sample _t_-test, continued 

```{r, out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(df, aes(group, weight)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(stat = "summary", fun.y = mean, #<<
             color = "red", size = 5) #<<
```

## Two-sample _t_-test, continued

Suppose that $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n$ (respectively, $Y_1,Y_2,\ldots,Y_m$) are taken from a populaion that follows $N(\mu_X,\sigma^2)$ (respectively, $N(\mu_Y,\sigma^2)$). Let 
$$\bar{X}=\frac{X_1+X_2+\cdots+X_n}{n}, \quad \bar{Y}=\frac{Y_1+Y_2+\cdots+Y_m}{m},$$  
and
$$S_X^2=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\bar{X})^2, \quad S_Y^2=\frac{1}{m-1}\sum_{j=1}^m(Y_j-\bar{Y})^2.$$  
Then
$\displaystyle{\frac{\bar{X}-\bar{Y}-(\mu_X-\mu_Y)}{\sqrt{S_p^2\left(\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{m}\right)}}}$ follows a $t$-distribution with $n+m-2$ degrees of freedom, where $\displaystyle{S_p^2=\frac{(n-1)S_X^2+(m-1)S_Y^2}{n+m-2}}$. Here $S_p^2$ is called *pooled variance*.

## Two-sample _t_-test, continued

```{r}
t.test(cont, fl, var.equal = TRUE)
```

---

## Two-sample _t_-test: Welch's test

Suppose that $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n$ (respectively, $Y_1,Y_2,\ldots,Y_m$) are taken from a populaion that follows $N(\mu_X,\sigma_X^2)$ (respectively, $N(\mu_Y,\sigma_Y^2)$). Let 
$$\bar{X}=\frac{X_1+X_2+\cdots+X_n}{n}, \quad \bar{Y}=\frac{Y_1+Y_2+\cdots+Y_m}{m},$$ 
and
$$S_X^2=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\bar{X})^2, \quad S_Y^2=\frac{1}{m-1}\sum_{j=1}^m(Y_j-\bar{Y})^2.$$ 
Then $\displaystyle{\frac{\bar{X}-\bar{Y}-(\mu_X-\mu_Y)}{\sqrt{\frac{S_X^2}{n}+\frac{S_Y^2}{m}}}}$ follows a $t$-distribution with $r$ degrees of freedom, where $\displaystyle{r=\frac{\left(\frac{S_X^2}{n}+\frac{S_Y^2}{m}\right)^2}{\frac{1}{n-1}\left(\frac{S_X^2}{n}\right)^2+\frac{1}{m-1}\left(\frac{S_Y^2}{m}\right)^2}}$.

---

## Two-sample _t_-test: Welch's test, continued

```{r}
t.test(cont, fl, var.equal = F)
```

---

## Two-sample _t_-test, exercise

Recall `iris` data set and create the following plot. 

```{r, echo = F, out.width = "50%"}
iris %>% filter(Species != "setosa") %>%
  ggplot(aes(Species, Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Based on this data, can you say that mean `Sepal.Width` is associated with `Species`? Test with and without equal population variance assumption.

---

## Paired _t_-test

Serum glucose levels in 11 dogs with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus were measured when they received diets that contained either low insoluble fiber or high insoluble fiber.

```{r}
low = c(9.44, 17.61, 8.89, 16.94, 10.39, 11.78, 15.06, 7.06, 
        19.56, 8.22, 23.17)
high = c(9.28, 8.67, 6.28, 12.67, 6.67, 7.28, 15.39, 5.61, 
         11.94, 5.11, 17.33)
```

Can we say that there is a difference in the serum glucose levels between the low-fiber and high-fiber diets?

--

This is a bit different from the previous examples in that the data are paired. 

---

## Paired _t_-test, continued

```{r, out.width = "40%"}
df <- data.frame(low, high) %>%
  mutate(obs = paste0("obs", 1:length(low))) %>%
  gather(key = diet, value = glucose, -obs) # long form #<< 

ggplot(df, aes(diet, glucose)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(group = obs)) # connect the match #<<
```

---

## Paired _t_-test, continued

Let $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n$ and $Y_1,Y_2,\ldots,Y_n$ be paired measurements from  population with mean $\mu_X$ and $\mu_Y$, respectively. Define $W_i=X_i-Y_i$ for $1\leq i \leq n$. Let $$\bar{W}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n W_i=\frac{W_1+W_2+\cdots+W_n}{n}$$ and 
$$S_W^2=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (W_i-\bar{W})^2.$$ Then $$\frac{\bar{W}-(\mu_X-\mu_Y)}{S_W/\sqrt{n}}$$ follows a $t$-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.  

---

## Paired _t_-test, continued

```{r}
t.test(high, low, paired = T)
```

---

## Paired _t_-test, exercise

Create the following plot using the data set `heights.txt`.

```{r}
ht <- read.table(file = "heights.txt", header = T, sep = " ") 
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width = "40%"}
ht %>%
  mutate(id = paste0("family", 1:nrow(ht))) %>%
  gather(key = member, value = height, -id) %>%
  ggplot(aes(member, height)) +
  geom_boxplot() 
```

--

Can we say that there is a difference between mom's heights and daughter's heights?
