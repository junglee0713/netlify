## Installing R/RStudio

- To install R, go to https://www.r-project.org/ and follow instruction there
    - Click on CRAN under Download on the left
    - Choose the closest mirror site (e.g. http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/)
    - Download R for your platform (Windows/Mac/Linux)
    
- To install RStudio (an integrated development environment for R), go to https://www.rstudio.com/ and follow instruction

---

## Why R? 

- Specialized for data analysis

- Many packages have been developed and are available

- Excellent graphics

- Free!

---

## R as a calculator


```r
5 + 3
```

```
## [1] 8
```


```r
# everything after # (pound sign) is ignored
# useful for comments
2 * 5 # product of 2 and 5
```

```
## [1] 10
```


```r
3^2
```

```
## [1] 9
```


```r
3**2
```

```
## [1] 9
```

---

## Variables

Variables can be used to store numerical values. 

- A variable can be a combination of letters (case sensitive), digits, period (.) and underscore (_).
- It must start with a letter or a period. If it starts with a period, it cannot be followed by a digit.
- Reserved words in R, such as `TRUE`, cannot be used as variables.


```r
Num1 &lt;- 5; Num2 &lt;- 3 # semicolon (;) can be used to separate lines
sum_num &lt;- Num1 + Num2
prod.num &lt;- Num1 * Num2
print(sum_num) 
```

```
## [1] 8
```

```r
print(prod.num)
```

```
## [1] 15
```

---

## Characters

Variables can also be used to store character values.


```r
first_name &lt;- "John" # use quotation marks for character strings
last_name &lt;- 'Smith' # single quotation also works
print(first_name)
```

```
## [1] "John"
```

```r
print(last_name)
```

```
## [1] "Smith"
```

---

## Functions

One or more values can produce new one using R functions.


```r
a &lt;- 1; b &lt;- 3
s &lt;- sum(a, b) # sum() is a function that computes the sum
print(s)
```

```
## [1] 4
```


```r
first_name &lt;- "John" 
last_name &lt;- "Smith"
# paste() puts together multiple character strings
full_name &lt;- paste(first_name, last_name) 
print(full_name)
```

```
## [1] "John Smith"
```

For detailed usage of a function, type `help(function_name)`, e.g. `help(paste)` or `?function_name`, e.g. `?paste`.

---

## Vectors

Multiple numerical values or characters can be saved as a single variable using an R function `c()`.


```r
vec1 &lt;- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 1, 4)
print(vec1)
```

```
## [1] 2 3 5 7 1 4
```


```r
vec2 &lt;- c("Drexel", "Univ", "School", "of", "Medicine")
print(vec2)
```

```
## [1] "Drexel"   "Univ"     "School"   "of"       "Medicine"
```

---

## Functions applied to a vector


```r
length(vec1)
```

```
## [1] 6
```


```r
sum(vec1)
```

```
## [1] 22
```


```r
DUSoM &lt;- paste(vec2, collapse = " ")
print(DUSoM)
```

```
## [1] "Drexel Univ School of Medicine"
```


```r
DUSoM2 &lt;- paste(vec2, collapse = "_")
print(DUSoM2)
```

```
## [1] "Drexel_Univ_School_of_Medicine"
```

---

## Vector manipulation

Use brackets `[]` to extract components of a vector.


```r
a &lt;- vec1[3]
print(a)
```

```
## [1] 5
```


```r
dm &lt;- vec2[c(1, 5)]
print(dm)
```

```
## [1] "Drexel"   "Medicine"
```

---

## Special vectors -- part I

Exercise: compute the sum `\(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 10\)`.


```r
w1 &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
sum(w1)
```

```
## [1] 55
```


```r
# colon (:) can be used to generate a vector consisting of 
# consecutive numbers
w2 &lt;- 1:10
print(w2)
```

```
##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
```

```r
sum(w2) 
```

```
## [1] 55
```

---

## Special vectors -- part II

Exercise: compute the sum `\(2 + 4 + 6 +\cdots + 20\)`.


```r
# one can use a function seq()
# type ?seq to get help
w3 &lt;- seq(2, 20, by = 2)
sum(w3)
```

```
## [1] 110
```

Alternatively, one can use the previous vector:


```r
w4 &lt;- 2*w1 # product of a single number and a vector
print(w4)
```

```
##  [1]  2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18 20
```

```r
sum(w4)
```

```
## [1] 110
```

---

## Data frame

Vectors of an equal length can be combined to form a data frame.


```r
# use of the function data.frame()
first_name &lt;- c("Lisa", "John", "Chuck", "Matt")
last_name &lt;- c("Simpson", "Smith", "Williams", "June")
age_yrs &lt;- c(8, 42, 81, 23)
book &lt;- data.frame(first = first_name,
                        last = last_name,
                        age = age_yrs)
print(book)
```

```
##   first     last age
## 1  Lisa  Simpson   8
## 2  John    Smith  42
## 3 Chuck Williams  81
## 4  Matt     June  23
```

```r
dim(book) # dimensions of a data frame: dim()
```

```
## [1] 4 3
```

---

## Handling data frames


```r
# extract a single element from a data frame
book[2, 3]
```

```
## [1] 42
```

```r
# extract a column: use $
age_extracted &lt;- book$age
print(age_extracted)
```

```
## [1]  8 42 81 23
```

```r
# extract a row
book[4, ]
```

```
##   first last age
## 4  Matt June  23
```

---

## Reading a data file 


```r
# heights.txt is a space-delimited file 
# consisting of 1375 observations
# of mom/daughter age height pairs
d &lt;- read.table(file = "heights.txt", header = TRUE, sep = " ")
```

A glance at a data frame:


```r
dim(d) # dimension
```

```
## [1] 1375    2
```

```r
names(d) # variable(column) names
```

```
## [1] "Mheight" "Dheight"
```

---

## Inspecting a data frame


```r
head(d) # first few rows (6 rows by default)
```

```
##   Mheight Dheight
## 1    59.7    55.1
## 2    58.2    56.5
## 3    60.6    56.0
## 4    60.7    56.8
## 5    61.8    56.0
## 6    55.5    57.9
```

```r
tail(d) # last few rows
```

```
##      Mheight Dheight
## 1370    69.5    70.4
## 1371    69.1    70.1
## 1372    65.0    71.6
## 1373    66.3    71.4
## 1374    70.8    71.0
## 1375    63.0    73.1
```

## Example: find the sample mean of mom's heights

Recall that the sample mean is given by sum of samples divided by the number of samples:
`$$\bar{x} = \frac{x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n}{n}$$`


```r
mom &lt;- d$Mheight
s &lt;- sum(mom)
n &lt;- length(mom)
mom_height_mean &lt;- s/n
print(mom_height_mean)
```

```
## [1] 62.4528
```

R has a built in function to compute the mean:


```r
mean(mom) # mean() gives the mean of a vector
```

```
## [1] 62.4528
```

---

## Sample variance

The sample variance measures spread of given data:
`$$s^2 =\frac{(x_1-\bar{x})^2+(x_2-\bar{x})^2+\cdots+(x_n-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}.$$`
Note that the denominator is `\(n-1\)`, not `\(n\)`.

R has a built in function to compute the sample variance:


```r
var(mom) # var() gives the sample variance of a vector
```

```
## [1] 5.546511
```

One could also compute the sample variance using the definition:


```r
v1 &lt;- mom-mean(mom); v2 &lt;- v1^2
sum(v2)/(length(mom)-1)
```

```
## [1] 5.546511
```

---

## Sample standard deviation

The sample standard deviation also measurs spread of given data -- it is simply the square root of the sample variance:
`$$s = \sqrt{s^2} = \sqrt{\frac{(x_1-\bar{x})^2+(x_2-\bar{x})^2+\cdots+(x_n-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}.$$`

R has a built in function to compute the sample standard deviation:


```r
sd(mom) # sd() gives the sample standard deviation of a vector
```

```
## [1] 2.355103
```

---

## Histogram

The first step of data analysis is often data visualization. A histogram is a good tool to understand the range and frequency of given data.


```r
library(tidyverse)
g1 &lt;- ggplot(d, aes(x = Mheight)) + geom_histogram()
print(g1)
```

&lt;img src="MLAS_2019_Lecture_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-33-1.png" width="40%" height="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Box plot

Box plots are great to quickly check the range and outliers of numerical data.


```r
# you don't need to worry about the code below for now
g2 &lt;- d %&gt;% gather(key = MomDaughter, value = Height) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = MomDaughter, y = Height)) +
  geom_boxplot()
print(g2)
```

&lt;img src="MLAS_2019_Lecture_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Scatter plot

Scatter plots are useful when finding the association of two sets of numerical data.


```r
g3 &lt;- ggplot(d, aes(x = Mheight, y = Dheight)) + geom_point()
print(g3)
```

&lt;img src="MLAS_2019_Lecture_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-35-1.png" width="45%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Even more fun stuff with R!


```r
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %&gt;% addTiles() %&gt;% setView(-75.1659, 39.9569, zoom = 15)
```
