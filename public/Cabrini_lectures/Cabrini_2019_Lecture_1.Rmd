## What is statistics?

- Statistics is the science of learning from data

- The goal of statistics is to summarize data in a way that allows for
easy descriptions or inferences of the data
  - Data visualization and computing are important parts of statistics

- R, a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics, will be used as a main tool throuout the course

---

## Why R? 

- Specialized for data analysis

- Many packages have been developed and are available

- Excellent graphics

- Free!

---

## Installing R/RStudio

- To install R, go to https://www.r-project.org/ and follow instruction there
    - Click on CRAN under Download on the left
    - Choose the closest mirror site (e.g. http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/)
    - Download R for your platform (Windows/Mac/Linux)
    
- To install RStudio (an integrated development environment for R), go to https://www.rstudio.com/ and follow instruction

## RStudio IDE overview

---

## R as a calculator

```{r}
5 + 3
```

```{r}
# everything after # (pound sign) is ignored
# useful for comments
2 * 5 # product of 2 and 5
```

```{r}
3^2
```

```{r}
3**2
```

---

## Variables

Variables can be used to store numerical values. 

- A variable can be a combination of letters (case sensitive), digits, period (.) and underscore (_).
- It must start with a letter or a period. If it starts with a period, it cannot be followed by a digit.
- Reserved words in R, such as `TRUE`, cannot be used as variables.

```{r}
Num1 <- 5; Num2 <- 3 # semicolon (;) can be used to separate lines
sum_num <- Num1 + Num2
prod.num <- Num1 * Num2
print(sum_num) 
print(prod.num)
```

---

## Characters

Variables can also be used to store character values.

```{r}
first_name <- "John" # use quotation marks for character strings
last_name <- 'Smith' # single quotation also works
print(first_name)
print(last_name)
```

---

## Functions

One or more values can produce new one using R functions.

```{r}
a <- 1; b <- 3
s <- sum(a, b) # sum() is a function that computes the sum
print(s)
```

```{r}
first_name <- "John" 
last_name <- "Smith"
# paste() puts together multiple character strings
full_name <- paste(first_name, last_name) 
print(full_name)
```

For detailed usage of a function, type `help(function_name)`, e.g. `help(paste)` or `?function_name`, e.g. `?paste`.

---

## Vectors

Multiple numerical values or characters can be saved as a single variable using an R function `c()`.

```{r}
vec1 <- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 1, 4)
print(vec1)
```

```{r}
vec2 <- c("Cabrini", "Univ", "MBIO", "612", "Spring", "2019")
print(vec2)
```

---

## Functions applied to a vector

```{r}
length(vec1)
```

```{r}
sum(vec1)
```

```{r}
CU <- paste(vec2, collapse = " ")
print(CU)
```

```{r}
CU2 <- paste(vec2, collapse = "_")
print(CU2)
```

---

## Vector manipulation

Use brackets `[]` to extract components of a vector.

```{r}
a <- vec1[3]
print(a)
```

```{r}
dm <- vec2[c(1, 5)]
print(dm)
```

---

## Special vectors -- part I

Exercise: compute the sum $1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 10$.

```{r}
w1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
sum(w1)
```

```{r}
# colon (:) can be used to generate a vector consisting of 
# consecutive numbers
w2 <- 1:10
print(w2)
sum(w2) 
```

---

## Special vectors -- part II

Exercise: compute the sum $2 + 4 + 6 +\cdots + 20$.

```{r}
# one can use a function seq()
# type ?seq to get help
w3 <- seq(2, 20, by = 2)
sum(w3)
```

Alternatively, one can use the previous vector:

```{r}
w4 <- 2*w1 # product of a single number and a vector
print(w4)
sum(w4)
```

---

## Data frame

Vectors of an equal length can be combined to form a data frame.

```{r}
# use of the function data.frame()
first_name <- c("Lisa", "John", "Chuck", "Matt")
last_name <- c("Simpson", "Smith", "Williams", "June")
age_yrs <- c(8, 42, 81, 23)
book <- data.frame(first = first_name,
                        last = last_name,
                        age = age_yrs)
print(book)
dim(book) # dimensions of a data frame: dim()
```

---

## Handling data frames

```{r}
# extract a single element from a data frame
book[2, 3]
# extract a column: use $
age_extracted <- book$age
print(age_extracted)
# extract a row
book[4, ]
```

---

## Reading a data file 

Download a [file](heights.txt) to be used in an example (Chrome users: Menu $\rightarrow$ More Tools $\rightarrow$ Save Page As).

```{r}
# heights.txt is a space-delimited file 
# consisting of 1375 observations
# of mom/daughter age height pairs
d <- read.table(file = "heights.txt", header = TRUE, sep = " ")
```

A glance at a data frame:

```{r}
dim(d) # dimension
names(d) # variable(column) names
```

---

## Inspecting a data frame

```{r}
head(d) # first few rows (6 rows by default)
tail(d) # last few rows
```

---

## A closer look at the data

```{r, echo = FALSE}
d %>% datatable(fillContainer = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 8)) %>%
  formatStyle(columns = 0:2, fontSize = '80%')
```

---

## Example: find the sample mean of mom's heights

Recall that the sample mean is given by sum of samples divided by the number of samples:
$$\bar{x} = \frac{x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n}{n}$$

```{r}
mom <- d$Mheight
s <- sum(mom)
n <- length(mom)
mom_height_mean <- s/n
print(mom_height_mean)
```

R has a built in function to compute the mean:

```{r}
mean(mom) # mean() gives the mean of a vector
```

---

## Sample variance

The sample variance measures spread of given data:
$$s^2 =\frac{(x_1-\bar{x})^2+(x_2-\bar{x})^2+\cdots+(x_n-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}.$$
Note that the denominator is $n-1$, not $n$.

R has a built in function to compute the sample variance:

```{r}
var(mom) # var() gives the sample variance of a vector
```

One could also compute the sample variance using the definition:

```{r}
v1 <- mom-mean(mom); v2 <- v1^2
sum(v2)/(length(mom)-1)
```

---

## Sample standard deviation

The sample standard deviation also measures spread of given data -- it is simply the square root of the sample variance:
$$s = \sqrt{s^2} = \sqrt{\frac{(x_1-\bar{x})^2+(x_2-\bar{x})^2+\cdots+(x_n-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}.$$

R has a built in function to compute the sample standard deviation:

```{r}
sd(mom) # sd() gives the sample standard deviation of a vector
```

---

## Histogram

The first step of data analysis is often data visualization. A histogram is a good tool to understand the range and frequency of given data.

```{r, out.height = "40%", out.width = '40%'}
library(tidyverse)
g1 <- ggplot(d, aes(x = Mheight)) + geom_histogram()
print(g1)
```

---

## Box plot

Box plots are great to quickly check the range and outliers of numerical data.

```{r, out.width = "40%"}
# you don't need to worry about the code below for now
g2 <- d %>% gather(key = MomDaughter, value = Height) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = MomDaughter, y = Height)) +
  geom_boxplot()
print(g2)
```

---

## Scatter plot

Scatter plots are useful when finding the association of two sets of numerical data.

```{r, out.width = "45%"}
g3 <- ggplot(d, aes(x = Mheight, y = Dheight)) + geom_point()
print(g3)
```

---

## Even more fun stuff with R!

```{r out.width='100%', out.height='60%'}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% setView(-75.3757, 40.0550, zoom = 15)
```
