In ecology, the Shannon diversity of a community is defined by
$$H=-\sum_{i}^R p_i\log p_i,$$
where $R$ is the number of distinct species and $p_i$ is the proportion of species $i$. The Shannon diversity measures richness (i.e. the number of distinct species in a community) and evenness (i.e. how evenly the proportions of species are spread). In the following illustration, each randomly generated dot represents a mock community: the horizontal coordinate shows the number of distinct species (richness) and the color shows the sample standard deviation of the proportions (evenness). The vertical coordinate gives the resulting Shannon diversity.
