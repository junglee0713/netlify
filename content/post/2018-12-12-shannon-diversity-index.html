<p>In ecology, the Shannon diversity of a community is defined by <span class="math display">\[H=-\sum_{i}^R p_i\log p_i,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is the number of distinct species and <span class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span> is the proportion of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. The Shannon diversity measures richness (i.e. the number of distinct species in a community) and evenness (i.e. how evenly the proportions of species are spread). In the following illustration, each randomly generated dot represents a mock community: the horizontal coordinate shows the number of distinct species (richness) and the color shows the sample standard deviation of the proportions (evenness). The vertical coordinate gives the resulting Shannon diversity.</p>
