<p>In ecology, the Shannon diversity of a community is defined by
<span class="math display">\[H=-\sum_{i}^R p_i\log p_i,\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is the number of distinct species and <span class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span> is the proportion of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. The Shannon diversity measures richness (i.e. the number of distinct species in a community) and evenness (i.e. how evenly the proportions of species are spread). In the following illustration, each dot represents a mock community: the horizontal coordinate shows the number of distinct species (richness) and the color shows the various distributions of proportions given the number of distinct species. <strong>Even distribution</strong> means that the proportions are evenly distributed (thus giving the maximum possible Shannon diversity). <strong>Proportion of most dominant species of 0.7</strong>, for example, means that the community is dominated by a single species which takes up 70%, and the remaining species are evenly distributed.</p>
