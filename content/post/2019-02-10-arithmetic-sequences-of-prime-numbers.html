<p>Today, I saw a question that goes as follows:</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\)</span> is an increasing arithmetic sequence of five prime numbers, what is the least possible value of <span class="math inline">\(|a-b|\)</span>?</p>
<p>Letâ€™s write the sequence as <span class="math inline">\(\{a, a+k, a+2k, a+3k, a+4k\}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(k \in \mathbb{N}\)</span>. It is easy to see that <span class="math inline">\(a\neq 2\)</span>. It is also easy to see that <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> cannot be odd.</p>
<p>Assume that <span class="math inline">\(k=2\)</span> and consider the remainders of <span class="math inline">\(\{a, a+2, a+4, a+6, a+8\}\)</span> when divided by <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> cannot be <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> (as <span class="math inline">\(a+6\)</span> is a prime), <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> must be of the form <span class="math inline">\(3m+1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(3m+2\)</span> and this would imply that either <span class="math inline">\(a+2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(a+4\)</span> is prime. This contradiction comes from the assumption that <span class="math inline">\(k=2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Assume that <span class="math inline">\(k=4\)</span> and consider the remainders of <span class="math inline">\(\{a, a+4, a+8, a+12, a+16\}\)</span> when divided by <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> cannot be <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> (as <span class="math inline">\(a+4\)</span> is a prime), <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> must be of the form <span class="math inline">\(5m+1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(5m+2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(5m+3\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(5m+4\)</span> and the same argument as above shows that <span class="math inline">\(k\neq 4\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now we know that <span class="math inline">\(k\geq 6\)</span>. Indeed the least possible value of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> turns out to be <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(\{5, 11, 17, 23, 29\}\)</span> consists of primes.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(primes)
max &lt;- 2000
by = 6
length.out = 5
p_seq &lt;- generate_primes(max = max)
for (i in seq(1, length(p_seq))) {
  candidate &lt;- seq(from = p_seq[i], by = by, length.out = length.out)
  call &lt;- all(candidate %in% p_seq)
  if (call) {
    print(candidate)
  }
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1]  5 11 17 23 29</code></pre>
<p>An argument similar to above can be used to show that one of <span class="math inline">\(\{a, a+6, a+12, a+18, a+24\}\)</span> is divisible by <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(\{5, 11, 17, 23, 29\}\)</span> is the only arithmetic sequence of primes with <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> terms with a common difference of <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span>.</p>
