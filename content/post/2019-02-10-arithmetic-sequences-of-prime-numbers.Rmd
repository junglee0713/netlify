Today, I saw a question that goes as follows:

If $\{a,b,c,d,e\}$ is an increasing arithmetic sequence of five prime numbers, what is the least possible value of $|a-b|$?

Let's write the sequence as $\{a, a+k, a+2k, a+3k, a+4k\}$, where $k \in \mathbb{N}$. It is easy to see that $a\neq 2$. It is also easy to see that $k$ cannot be odd. 

Consider the remainders of $\{a, a+2, a+4\}$ when divided by $3$. Since $a$ is prime, $a$ must be of the form $3m+1$ or $3m+2$ and this would imply that either $a+2$ or $a+4$ is prime. This shows that $k\neq 2$.

Consider the remainders of $\{a, a+4, a+8, a+12, a+16\}$ when divided by $5$. Since $a$ is prime, $a$ must be of the form $5m \pm 1$ or $5m \pm 2$ and the same argument as above shows that $k\neq 4$. 

Now we know that $k\geq 6$. Indeed the least possible value of $k$ turns out to be $6$ because $\{5, 11, 17, 23, 29\}$ consists of primes. 

```{r}
library(primes)
max <- 1000
by = 6
length.out = 5
p_seq <- generate_primes(max = max)
for (i in seq(1, length(p_seq)-4)) {
  candidate <- seq(from = p_seq[i], by = 6, length.out = length.out)
  call <- all(candidate %in% p_seq)
  if (call) {
    print(candidate)
  }
}
```

An argument similar to above can be used to show that one of $\{a, a+6, a+12, a+18, a+24\}$ is divisible by $5$, so $\{5, 11, 17, 23, 29\}$ is the only arithmetic sequence of primes with $5$ terms with a common difference of $6$.
